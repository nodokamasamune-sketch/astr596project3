    Initialize one packet with luminosity-weighted star selection.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    stars : list of Star objects
    L_packet : float
        Luminosity carried by this packet (pre-calculated)
    band : str or None
        If specified ('B', 'V', or 'K'), run for single band
